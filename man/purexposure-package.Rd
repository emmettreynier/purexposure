\title{purexposure: A package for working with CA Pesticide Use Registry data.}
\description{
The \code{purexposure} package provides functions to pull data from California's
Pesticide Use Registry (PUR), as well as to calculate exposure to and
visualize active ingredients present in applied pesticides. Functions are
categorized into \code{find_*}, \code{pull_*}, \code{calculate_*},
\code{plot_*}, and \code{write_*}. These are the functions from each category:
}
\section{find_* functions}{

\code{find_} functions help with searches of PUR chemical, county, and
product codes.
\itemize{
  \item \code{find_chemical_codes}: Pull active ingredient chemical codes
  from PUR Chemical Lookup Tables.
  \item \code{find_counties}: Find California county codes or names.
  \item \code{find_location_county}: Find the counties of addresses or
  coordinates.
  \item \code{find_product_name}: Find Pesticide Product names and registration
  numbers from PUR Product Lookup Tables.
}
}

\section{pull_* functions}{

\code{pull_} functions facilitate downloading data from the CA Department
of Pesticide Regulation's website.
\itemize{
  \item \code{pull_raw_pur}: Pull raw PUR data by counties and years.
  \item \code{pull_clean_pur}: Pull cleaned PUR data by counties, years, and
  active ingredients.
  \item \code{pull_product_table}: Pull PUR Product Tables for a vector of
  years.
  \item \code{pull_spdf}: Pull section or township-level
  SpatialPolygonsDataFrame for a county.
}
}

\section{calculate_* function}{

The \code{calculate_exposure} function calculates exposure (in kg/m^2) to
applied pesticides for a given location, buffer extending from that location,
time period, and active ingredients.
}

\section{plot_* functions}{

\code{plot_} functions help with visualizations of application.
\itemize{
  \item \code{plot_county_application}: Plot pesticide application by county,
  summed by section or township.
  \item \code{plot_county_locations}: Plot county locations in California.
  \item \code{plot_exposure}: Plot exposure to applied pesticides at a
  particular location.
  \item \code{plot_application_timeseries}: Plot time series of active
  ingredients in applied pesticides.
  \item \code{plot_locations_exposure}: Plot exposure for multiple locations
  in a given county.
}
}

\section{write_* function}{

The \code{write_exposure} function calculates exposure for multiple locaitons
and writes out files (exposure values, meta data, and plots) to a specified
directory.
